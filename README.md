## here lie all the notebooks for the analysis of emotional arcs within the Project Gutenberg corpus, see [The emotional arcs of stories are dominated by six basic shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07772)


we are happy to send over copies of the full dataset, of course you can also generate it yourself from downloading the raw ebooks (and using this code! but it's not a push-button reproduction yet).
(see below for more instructions).


send any comments, questions, etc to [@andyreagan](https://twitter.com/andyreagan)


pull requests accepted as well!

## building the paper

run the associated makefile!

```
make
```

this likely won't work, since the full database from Gutenberg is not in this repository. but it's the general idea.

if you want to reproduce the results, ask and we will be happy to send the data your way :)
