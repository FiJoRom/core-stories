# core-stories

## here lie all the notebooks for the analysis of emotional arcs within the Project Gutenberg corpus, see [The emotional arcs of stories are dominated by six basic shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07772)


we are happy to send over copies of the full dataset, of course you can also generate it yourself from downloading the raw ebooks (and using this code! but it's not a push-button reproduction yet).


send any comments, questions, etc to [@andyreagan](https://twitter.com/andyreagan)


pull requests accepted as well!
